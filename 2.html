B E R R Y!</p> <p> Juicy, sweet berries are highly perishable and are often a luxury item at the grocery store. Grow berries in your home garden instead , for a delicious summer treat that’s packed with vitamins, fiber, and cancer-fighting antioxidants. </p> <p> Do your research before eating any berry you are not familiar with, as<strong> some are toxic</strong> .</p> <h2> Which Fruits Are Berries?</h2> <p> When classifying fruits into the berry family, the distinctions can be blurred. </p> <p> You might have questions. Are bananas berries? Surely a strawberry is a berry?</p> <p> If we look at the botanical definition, a berry is:</p> <p> “A fleshy fruit without a stone (pit) produced from a single flower containing one ovary.” Source: Wikipedia </p> <p> So, technically speaking, grapes, eggplants, and even bananas are classed as berry fruits. While what you normally consider berries, like strawberries and raspberries do not fit the definition.</p> <p> This is because they develop from a single flower with more than one ovary. And this makes them an aggregate fruit.</p> <p> But generally, most of us consider a berry to be <strong> any small, bright-colored, edible fruit </strong> without a stone or pit. </p> <p> Thinking of growing berries in your garden? Check out the helpful tips in the video below.</p> <p> our garden.</p> <p> The list is long and it doesn’t end with strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries.</p> <p> Berries are known for their health benefits .

The dark purple fruit grows in clusters in palm trees native to the Amazon jungle of South America. </p> <p> They are inedible in their whole form, so people usually consume them in the form of powder. The fact that they&#8217;re difficult to source outside the native region adds to steep prices.</p> <h3> Agarita berry</h3> Source : Julia Gregory <p> Native to Texas. Edible and used to make jelly. Attracts birds and mammals. Also known as agarito, algerita, agritos, currant-of-Texas, wild currant, chaparral berry. </p> <p> Agarita berries are difficult to harvest because of their thorny, five-pronged leaves. They’re toothsome in tarts, cobblers, and juices. </p> <h3> Amla</h3> Source: Firoze Shakir <p> Also known as Amalika or Indian Gooseberry. Those sour tasting and fibrous berries are native to India. They grow on small to medium-sized trees and have many health benefits .</p> <p> Amla is used in Ayurvedic medicine in powder form as well as in fresh form and as dried berries. It’s rich in Vitamin C , flavonoids and ellagic acid known for its anti-infective properties.</p> <h3> Baneberry</h3> Source: WikiCommons <p> Baneberries are small, hard red or white berries.

Also, the tart taste will be more or prominent in some varieties than others.</p> <p> Barberries are often used as dried berries .</p> <h3> Bearberry</h3> Source: WikiMedia <p> Found in arctic and subarctic zones around the world, the bearberry produces red berries enjoyed by bears and humans alike. Native people gather the leaves of bearberry plants and use them as folk medicine. </p> <p> The purported health benefits of bearberries are manifold. They provide relief from rheumatoid arthritis, gout, back pain, headaches, and kidney stones.</p> <p> They can be grown throughout the US .</p> <h3> Bilberry</h3> Source: MrGajowy3 <p> Similar to blueberries, these flavorful berries grow wild throughout northern Europe.

These natural agents will have strong effects on the long term health of berries.</p> <p> Also be sure to keep your berry patches:</p> Away from wild berry varieties (to prevent disease and cross-contamination) A safe distance from other plant patches in your garden (so they can grow undisturbed) <p> If you’re growing different berry varieties, make sure to remove any dead canes or runners. Take extra care with strawberries since they can spread out of control and endanger other crops. <br> Frankie Flowers , a gardening expert, shares insider tips on how to grow different types of berries, from raspberries and blackberries to white strawberries.</p> <p> The world of berries extends far beyond the few commonly grown or found in grocery stores. Many berries that grow wild are safe to eat. Yet be sure to<strong> consult a field guide</strong> to accurately identify any berry before you consume it. Berries resembling blackberries and raspberries are often safe, as are wild strawberries.</p> <p> Did we miss any berries?

Pineapple is a true berry, as the raspberry, strawberry, and soooooo many others. Each of the little &#8220;diamond&#8221; shapes is an individual fruit.</p> <p> BTW, Avocado is not technically a berry: it is a &#8220;drupe&#8221;, a fruit bearing a single, large, centrally-positioned seed</p> Reply <p> <span> Angel</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 24, 2020 at 7:16 pm </p> <p> Avocados are botanically berries, just a single seeded berry.

LOL Among a myriad of old keepsakes I&#8217;ve inherited recently, there&#8217;s a small cloth bag filled with about 1/4 cup of dried berries. The bag and contents have to be around 100 years old. At first I thought they were seed. There is a ink-stained note attached that reads somthing like: &#8220;Mus krat berrys from the Muskrat trees in _ _ _. The horses was very fond of them. These are over 40 years old.&#8221; (written before 1955) The words that I&#8217;m interpreting as &#8220;Muskrat&#8221; are smeared only the Mus, the &#8220;k&#8221; and the &#8220;t&#8221; are pretty clear. Any ideas of what this would be.

Do the &#8220;seeds&#8221; inside of the Muskeet tree beans look like dried berries? Would horses &#8220;love&#8221; them?

I was thinking the same thing! Pokemon dork right here. This list has been extremely helpful. Even if it&#8217;s not covering everything, it&#8217;s covering a good bit. Plus, when I&#8217;m looking for information on berries, a blackberry, etc., better be included even if it&#8217;s not was some call a true berry. I mean, berry is in the name. When I think about looking for berries, blackberries are one of the main things that come to mind. Were talking about foraging in the woods and junk, not scientific crap. Is it safe to eat? That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important here. Not what something technically is or isnt, regarding terminology. Edibility and safety are what people are most likely looking for. Anyway, thank you for taking the time to make this list. It saved me a lot of work, as now I can find more information on the plants listed here. Rather than trying to look up every berry singularly, im not too experienced here, and only know a handful of berries by name. Its hard to find something when you don&#8217;t even know what it&#8217;s called. Again thank you for your time.

Look it up. They are of the melon and gourde family of fruits which grow on creeping vines, normally on the ground.</p> <p> Tamara Dawn is the only one with some sense. Marion berries are an actual berry. </p> <p> It seems the berry list and the commentators forgot to mention Lychee, a fruit commonly grown in China and in some areas of Southeast Asia, particularly Guangdong and Yunnan, where oolong tea derives from ancient trees more than a thousand years old. Nevertheless, Lychee is the sole member of the genus Litchi in the Soapberry family, so technically it would botanically and agriculturally be classified as a berry.</p> <p> Note: for Shafeeqa and others like her: read the notations on the list of berries; anything resembling blueberries, blackberries and raspberries are normally nontoxic. Nontoxic. Nontoxic. Did I mention they would be nontoxic. </p> <p> As for Shafeeqa&#8217;s comment: It is not correct to say or write that: &#8220;I got a small tree in my backyard and it got light purple berries that looks like a cherry seed.&#8221; This entire sentence is grammatically atrocious. It would take me to long to explain. Nevertheless, I will write out a better way so that the ears of the educated will not be painfully subjected to idiocy. Instead, the sentence could have been written: I have* (in place of &#8220;I got&#8221;) a small tree in my back yard and it has* (in place of &#8220;it got&#8221;) light purple berries growing from it. Also, instead of saying: it has &#8220;a seed like a cherry&#8221; you can say: It has a seed that resembles the cherry fruit.</p> <p> Is it that much to ask the world over to speak and write proper English? If you&#8217;re going to speak English at least do everyone a favor and make use of it correctly. When I learned Afrikaans I made sure I learned it fluently before I spoke and wrote it fluently. I would expect this level of incompetence from U.S. and British citizens but not someone from South Africa. Then again, is not South Africa an old dominion of the Dutch and British colonial empires, where Afrikaans is nothing more than a Low Franconian West Germanic language descended from the Dutch vernacular and long derided as rhotic and inferior to the mother language? Of course, and even though it gradually grew to have developed distinguishable characteristics by the mid- to late-18th-century detractors continue to deride that the Afrikaans language is nothing more than spoken out of laziness and a lack of a formal education. Unique, yes, but relatively isolated and primitive, even more.</p> <p> For anyone who thinks avocados and watermelons are berries why are you even on this webpage? Why? Just to make silly, erroneous, uneducated comments. There are real people who view this site to learn because we are amature or intermediate horticulturalists and/or botanists who want to learn more about what we do and perfect on it. The totality of comments only shows how dimwitted and unrealistic you are as people.

The Gooseberry is from the family Grossulariaceae. The Cape gooseberry is a member of the plant family Solanaceae, it is more distantly related to a large number of edible plants, including tomato, eggplant, potato and other members of the nightshades and despite its name, it is not closely related to any of the cherry, Indian gooseberry, or Chinese gooseberry. So each has their different characteristics despite &#8216;same name&#8217;, one is sweet, the other not so much, anyhow, if people are aware before they grow these both tasty berries they can research which one they prefer hope this helps, Cheers, Linda</p> Reply <p> <span> Adrian</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 18, 2015 at 10:28 am </p> <p> There&#8217;s also the Olallieberry a hybrid of the Loganberry and the Youngberry. </p> <p> I think we need to distiguish between the botanical defintion and the cullinary definiton of a berry. If we&#8217;re going to be technical / botanical a bananna could be considered a berry but it would not be appropriate for this list.

Pomegranates, kiwis, and bananas are all berries.</p> Reply <p> <span> Darrell Yetman</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 10, 2016 at 2:04 pm </p> <p> On the island of Newfoundland, and maybe other areas of eastern Canada, there is a berry that grows in shaded mossy places in the evergreen forests. My mother told me many years ago that it is called Maidenhair Berry. The berries resemble tiny long white eggs, about 1/4 inch long, and have to be pulled up out of the moss on long strings of maidenhair fern. They have a faint taste of wintergreen, but you need quite a lot of them to get a good mouthful. The treat is well worth the search.<br/> Also in Newfoundland, the lingonberry is called partridgeberry, and there is a similar one that grows in marshes which is known as marsh-berry.<br/> The cloudberry is known in Newfoundland and Labrador as bake-apple, and is certainly not &#8220;bland&#8221;, as described above. The flavour is intensely delicious and a little acidic. Used widely in baking, syrups, and even alcoholic liqueur, bake apples are relatively expensive to purchase from local pickers.<br/> We also have a high-bush squash berry. The fruit is bright translucent red, round and about 1/4 inch in diameter. It has a large flat seed which makes it necessary to sieve the pulp when making jelly.<br/> The wild mountain ash tree, actually a large shrub, is locally known as dogberry. The berries occur in large bright orange clusters and are somewhat bitter, although not toxic. They can be made into dogberry wine, but are usually left for the wild birds in the fall.</p> Reply <p> <span> HelplessGardener</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 12, 2016 at 8:24 pm </p> <p> Hi, i had a tree before at my backyard. I think it was owned by the previous owners. It produces red berry/cherry-like fruits. We always thought that it were just cherries grown in the tropical that&#8217;s why it looked and tasted kinda different from normal cherries we usually see on tv. So, the fruit resembles a tiny cherry because it is light red and has a green stem. Its not poisonous as birds tend to eat it too, and well, my family members arent sick or anything. And it tastes kinda sweet, but its is very liquidy and has tiny seeds which gives that rough-ish taste in your mouth when you eat it. We would eat it everytime the green cherries go ripe. The tree looks like a normal tree, almost like an apple tree? but it has long pretty shaped leaves. My dad decided to cut it down a few years ago because the leaves that shed gave us so much work, we had to rake the backyard everyday. But now, my mom is really into gardening and she wanted to plant that tree again. We tried searching for its baby trees or roots that had been left, but none was there.

It looks like a blueberry but it is black, a little larger than a blueberry, and covered with fine hair-like material. It grew wild on my parent’s property in south-east Tennessee. The flavor was very similar to a blueberry but sweeter and juicier. My mother told me that they only grow wild and that they always called them bearberries (because they looked like black bears). I have not seen them in years and I&#8217;ve never seen them anywhere else. Do you have any idea what they are actually called?</p> Reply <p> <span> Me</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 22, 2016 at 7:59 pm </p> <p> Bear berries or huckleberry depending upon where u live</p> Reply <p> <span> Ida K</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> July 16, 2017 at 11:36 pm </p> <p> Huckleberries aren&#8217;t hairy so that one&#8217;s out.

Technically, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion. A strawberry is not a berry, and neither is a raspberry. They are aggregate fruits. Bananas, avocados, and pumpkins are berries. It&#8217;s okay to be mistaken; nobody knows everything.

Hawthorne berries are less flavorful, harder, and have big seeds in them.

Are you able to tell me what they are and if they are edible?

This is really helpful for me 🙂</p> Reply <p> <span> John Ford</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 27, 2020 at 1:15 am </p> <p> You forgot the Serviceberries. Amelanchier spp, also known as shadbush, shadwood or shadblow, serviceberry or sarvisberry, or just sarvis, juneberry, saskatoon, sugarplum or wild-plum, and chuckley pear is a genus of about 20 species of deciduous-leaved shrubs and small trees in the rose family. Makes good jelly.</p> Reply <p> <span> John Ford</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 27, 2020 at 1:22 am </p> <p> You forgot the Pawpaw. Pawpaw trees can be found growing wild in the U.S. as a shade-loving, understory tree. Pawpaws are actually very large berries, sometimes growing longer than 6 inches. They turn from green to yellow (or brown) when ripe. The fruit has a strong tropical flavor — similar to bananas, pineapples, or mangoes</p> Reply <p> <span> John Ford</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 27, 2020 at 1:33 am </p> <p> You forgot Mayhaws. The mayhaw, the fruit of the mayhaw tree, is a lesser-known berry that is harvested in May. They&#8217;re actually hawthorn berries that ripen and drop in early summer, around the month of May. Mayhaw trees (Crataegus aestivalis, C. opaca, and C . rufula) are indigenous to the southern United States and grow in the wild as far west as Texas.</p> Reply <p> <span> conrad blackburn</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> March 8, 2020 at 6:04 am </p> <p> The Australian Midgum berry, a purple and white fruit.

I don&#8217;t recall anything about the shrub, but it produced mid to dark purple berries about an inch and a half long, half to three quarters inches across, and as I remember, it was blocky, almost square looking at it from the end.

I live in Jamaica and i have been eating berries that looks like the Privet berry. It should be poisonous but i have been eating it everyday from the beginning of this month (September 2020). These berries grow on a tree with a smooth bark is it the same tree?

Leaves and fruit the same color. The fruit turns red when I think the fruit is dying.
