Do you wish to have an extensive fruit list with pictures? Scroll down to find a list of fruits with brief information on the same.</p> <h3> Fruits</h3> <p> <span> Fruits are nature&#8217;s treasure or rather nature&#8217;s gift to human beings. Fruits are the tastiest of all healthy foods. They are healthy because they contain all the essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and sugar, that are required by human beings on a regular basis. Fresh fruits, in their natural form, are also easy to digest, as compared to nutritional supplements. Therefore, fruits can be consumed by people of any age group.</span> </p> <h3> Definition</h3> <p> When asked to define a fruit, most of us will suggest that a fruit is that component of a plant which has a pulpy flesh, which often tastes sweet, tangy, sour or even sharp. Secondly, fruits have attractive colors and can be classified into different types. However, in botany, a fruit is defined as the one that contains seeds and is derived from a flower. Fruits, indirectly aid in reproduction through the process of seed dispersal.</p> <p> Would you like to write for us? Well, we're looking for good writers who want to spread the word. Get in touch with us and we'll talk...</p> <p> Let's Work Together! </p> <p> If you take a look at the botanical definition of fruits, you will note that several vegetables can also be categorized into the &#8216;fruit&#8217; group. This is indeed true. There are several vegetables that are botanically fruits. However, here we have mentioned only those that can be traditionally classified into the &#8216;fruits&#8217; category. If you are looking for a list of all fruits with pictures, then you are at the right place. Mentioned below are the different kinds of fruits grown in the world.</p> <h2> Fleshy Fruits</h2> <p> <span> Fleshy fruits, as the name suggests, have a soft pulpy wall, with seeds at the center. They have a soft edible part in between their outer cover and the seeds. This is a vast category of fruits and more than half of the known fruits are categorized into this group of fruits. An apple or a pear are excellent examples of fleshy fruits. It should also be noted that other types of fruits like dried fruits, citrus fruits and melons form a subpart of this larger group of fleshy fruits.</span> </p> <h3> Apple</h3> <h3> Apricot</h3> <h3> Avocado</h3> <h3> Cherry</h3> <h3> Dragon Fruit</h3> <h3> Lychee</h3> <h3> Mango</h3> <h3> Olive</h3> <h3> Papaya</h3> <h3> Peach</h3> <h3> Pear</h3> <h3> Plum</h3> </p> <h2> Dried Fruits</h2> <p> <span> Dried fruits are also categorized under the fleshy fruits group. When we say dried fruits, we often think of cashews, walnuts and almonds. However, apart from these, there are several other fruits that can be categorized as dried fruits. In simplest words, dried fruits can be defined as fruits that are dried naturally or mechanically in order to remove their original water content. Apart from the usual dried fruits (nuts and seeds), several other fruits like apples, peaches, apricots, etc. are also dried and used for culinary purposes.</span> </p> <h3> Almonds</h3> <h3> Brazil Nut</h3> <h3> Cashew</h3> <h3> Chestnuts</h3> <h3> Date</h3> <h3> Fig</h3> <h3> Hazelnut</h3> <h3> Macadamia Nut</h3> <h3> Prune</h3> <h3> Pistachio</h3> <h3> Raisin</h3> <h3> Walnut</h3> </p> <h2> Citrus Fruits</h2> <p> <span> Citrus fruits are the ones that belong to the genus &#8216;Citrus&#8217;. They are acidic, juicy and usually have a sharp taste. All citrus fruits are rich sources of vitamin C which is required by the body to carry out different functions. Citrus fruits also have detoxifying properties, and hence, are used in some detoxification diet plans like the Master Cleanse (lemonade diet).</span> </p> <h3> Clementine</h3> <h3> Grapefruit</h3> <h3> Kumquat</h3> <h3> Lemon</h3> <h3> Lime</h3> <h3> Mandarin Orange</h3> <h3> Minneola Tangelo</h3> <h3> Orange</h3> <h3> Pomelo</h3> <h3> Sweetie</h3> <h3> Tangerine</h3> <h3> Ugli</h3> </p> <h2> Melons</h2> <p> <span> There is a lot of debate on whether melon is a fruit or a vegetable. Scientifically, a melon is a fruit (based on the definition mentioned above). However, the confusion lies because of the fact that melons, cucumbers, squash, etc. belong to the same family, i.e., gourds. Watermelon, cantaloupe, etc. are examples of melons, which are categorized as fruits. Melons are also classified into the broad category of fleshy fruits because they have an edible pulpy flesh.</span> </p> <h3> Cantaloupe</h3> <h3> Honeydew</h3> <h3> Squash</h3> <h3> Watermelon</h3> </p> <h2> Multiple Fruits</h2> <p> <span> Multiple fruits are called so because they are developed from multiple flowers. Every single flower produces a fruit, which is then assembled naturally as a whole. Therefore, what we see as a whole fruit is actually a bunch of fruits. One of the classic examples of multiple flowers is pineapple. Some berries like the strawberry also belong to this category of fruits.</span> </p> <h3> Breadfruit</h3> <h3> Jackfruit</h3> <h3> Osage-orange</h3> <h3> Pineapple</h3> </p> <h2> Berries</h2> <p> <span> Berries also belong to the larger group of fruits, i.e., fleshy fruits as they have a pulpy flesh. However, scientifically speaking, berries are fruits that have a pulpy flesh with one or more seeds embedded in it. In that case, a tomato or a banana is also considered as a berry. Whereas, a strawberry is not actually a berry because it has seeds on the outer part of its cover. Berries are extensively used for culinary purposes.</span> </p> <h3> Acai Berry</h3> <h3> Barberries</h3> <h3> Bearberries</h3> <h3> Blackberries</h3> <h3> Blueberries</h3> <h3> Boysenberries</h3> <h3> Cranberry</h3> <h3> Elderberry</h3> <h3> Gooseberry</h3> <h3> Grapes</h3> <h3> Juniper Berry</h3> <h3> Kiwi</h3> <h3> Raspberry</h3> <h3> Redcurrant</h3> <h3> Salmonberry</h3> <h3> Sea-buckthorn</h3> <h3> Strawberry</h3> </p> <h2> Miscellaneous Fruits</h2> <p> <span> Here are some miscellaneous fruits with pictures that can be categorized into either of the above-mentioned categories. For e.g., the banana is a fleshy fruit, while blackcurrant, crowberries and goji berries are berries. The fruits mentioned here are native to only certain parts of the world and are not grown all over.</span> </p> <h3> Banana</h3> <h3> Blackcurrant</h3> <h3> Coconut</h3> <h3> Goji Berry</h3> <h3> Passion Fruit</h3> </p> <p> Would you like to write for us? Well, we're looking for good writers who want to spread the word. Get in touch with us and we'll talk...</p> <p> Let's Work Together! </p> <p> <span> Apart from the list mentioned above, there are several other fruits found in the world. Therefore, in order to have a full list of fruits, you can also include fruits like bilberry, chokeberries, chokecherry, cloudberry, hawthorn, huckleberries, Indian plum (jujube), lingonberries, loganberries, marionberries, mulberries, nannyberry, nectarines, olalliberries, pomegranate, rhubarb, serviceberries, tayberries, wild rose, etc. in the list. But, hundreds of varieties of fruits are found on the Earth; and most of them are unknown as they are grown only in native places. Therefore, compiling the complete list is quite difficult.</span> </p> <p> <span> This was an extensive list of fruits along with their pictures. By and large, everyone loves fruits. They are healthy and should definitely be included in the daily diet. Also, remember the cliché, </span> <i> An apple (any fruit) a day keeps the doctor away</i> <span> !</span> </p> <p> Like it?
